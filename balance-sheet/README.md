## Step 4
Screen readers announce HTML elements based on the document flow. We will eventually want the balance sheet to have a heading of "Balance Sheet" and a subheading of "AcmeWidgetCorp". However, this order does not make sense if announced by a screen reader.

Give your existing span the class attribute set to flex, and add two span elements within it. Give the first the text AcmeWidgetCorp. Give the second the text Balance Sheet. You will use CSS to reverse the order of the text on the page, but the HTML order will make more sense for a screen reader.

## Step 5
Below your h1 element, create a div element. Give it an id attribute set to years. You want this particular element to be hidden from screen readers, so give it the aria-hidden attribute set to true.

## Step 11
Within each of your new th elements, nest a span element with the class set to sr-only year. Give them the following text (in order): 2019, 2020, and 2021.

Give your third th element the class attribute set to current.

Leave the td element empty. This element exists only to ensure your table has a four-column layout and associate the headers with the correct columns.

## Step 30
Before you get too far into your styling, you should make use of the sr-only class. You can use CSS to make elements with this class completely hidden from the visual page, but still be announced by screen readers.

The CSS you are about to write is a common set of properties used to ensure elements are completely hidden visually.

The span[class~="sr-only"] selector will select any span element whose class includes sr-only. Create that selector, and give it a border property set to 0.
